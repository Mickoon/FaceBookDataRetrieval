# FaceBookDataRetrieval
With using FaceBook API, the program retrieves all possible data :)

Before running this program, it is very important to set the connection with your PC's database, then create tables (sql files are already created and available here!).

I have used Microsoft SQL management Studio for the database.

This program is designed in UI based. 

This program has been used by phd students since Oct 2014 for research purpose in the University of Auckland.
